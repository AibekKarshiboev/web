## Team Members: Akzhol Suborov Aibek Karshiboev
## About project
This project is about calculator made by using react. You can solve arithmetic solutions. We mean +, -, /, *.

## Feedbaks: 
Great. Very good analogue real calculator. The app has a lot of arithmetic functions. The design of app is great. Also I liked this form Venera

I will criticize the work which was creates by Aibek and Akzhol. This react app was designed very cool. And it is awesome, I liked it. The app is about arithmetic , it is created professionally. I appreciate this work. I look forward to the same cool projects. Nuriza Paishan kyzy

Very convenient and well-developed react app. I really liked the design of the calculator, all the colors are worked out very well, without any unnecessary things. everything works fine. I think everything is perfectly done if we will compare it with our level of programming. Nice work, I like it. Nazim


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
